ALMOND MACAROONS
These dainty almond cookies trace
their origin back to 18th-century
Italy. Serve after dinner with coffee.
MAKES 12–20
115g (4oz) blanched almonds
75g (21⁄2oz) caster sugar
1–2 drops of almond extract
1 egg white
1 Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Line one or two baking sheets with
parchment paper.
2 Put the almonds in a food processor
and pulse the machine on and off, just
until finely ground. (Do not over-mix.)
Add the sugar and process again until
well mixed. Add the almond extract
and egg white and pulse until the
mixture forms a soft, sticky paste.
(Or, finely grind the almonds using
a pestle and mortar, then transfer to
a bowl and mix in the sugar, almond
extract, and egg white.)
3 Wet your hands and
form teaspoons of the almond
paste into small, evenly sized balls.
Place these, not touching, on the
baking sheet(s).
4 Bake for 10–12 minutes, until pale
golden. Remove from the oven and
transfer to a wire rack to cool. The
macaroons should be slightly soft
inside. Store in an airtight container.

APPLE SAUCE
The flavor of apples contrasts well
with rich meats. A family favorite,
this sauce goes well with roast pork.
CLASSIC RECIPE
SERVES 4
1lb (450g) tart apples, such as
Granny Smith
2 tbsp granulated sugar, or more to taste
juice of 1⁄2 lemon
1⁄2 cinnamon stick
pinch of salt
2 tbsp butter, cut into pieces
1 Peel, core, and coarsely chop the
apples, and place in a heavy saucepan
with ½ cup of water, the sugar, lemon,
cinnamon, and salt. Cover and cook
over medium heat, shaking the pan
occasionally, for 12–15 minutes, or
until the apples are tender, but not
dried out. Remove the
cinnamon stick. Taste,
stirring in more sugar,
if needed.
2 Take the pan off the
heat and, using a fork,
beat in the butter. If
desired, press the
apples through a
coarse sieve, or put
into a blender or
food processor to
make a smoother
sauce. Serve warm.
This sauce keeps
well, covered, in the
refrigerator for up to 3 days.
Reheat before serving.

APPLE STRUDEL
There are many different fillings for
this traditional Central-European
pastry, but apple remains a favorite.
Filo is a convenient substitute for
strudel pastry.
SERVES 4–6
11⁄4lb (600g) cooking apples,
peeled, cored, and cut into medium—
small chunks
finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon
6 tbsp granulated sugar
2 tsp ground cinnamon
½ cup dark raisins
6 sheets filo pastry (keep covered with a
clean, damp cloth to prevent the sheets
from drying out)
4 tbsp butter, melted
2 tbsp dry bread crumbs
confectioners’ sugar, to dust
1 Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
Butter a large baking sheet.
2 Mix together the apples, lemon zest
and juice, sugar, cinnamon, and
raisins. Set aside.
3 Lay a clean kitchen towel on a work
surface and place a sheet of filo pastry
on top, with one of the longer sides
closest to you. Brush with melted butter,
then cover with another sheet of filo,
placing it over half of the first sheet, so
you are increasing the length of the
strudel. Brush this sheet with butter.
Repeat with the remaining sheets.
4 Sprinkle the bread crumbs over the
long pastry sheet, leaving a 2in (5cm)
border around the edges.
5 Arrange the apple mixture down the
middle of the filo, then roll up away
from you like a jellyroll, using the
towel to help. Tuck in the ends of the
pastry to encase the filling.
6 Brush with melted butter. Carefully lift
on to the baking sheet, seam-side down.
7 Bake for 30–40 minutes, or until
golden brown and crisp. Loosen the
strudel with a metal spatula, then
carefully slide on to a serving plate.
Dust with confectioners’ sugar. Serve
hot or cold, with whipped cream.

APRICOT AND ALMOND TART
When apricots are not in season,
make this popular European dessert
with fresh peaches or nectarines.

9oz (250g) cold pie dough or puff pastry
2 tbsp apricot jam
1lb (500g) fresh apricots, halved

about 12 x 9in (30 x 23cm). Trim
the edges with a sharp knife. Place
on a lightly greased baking sheet.
3 Spread the jam over the pastry
to within 3⁄4in (2cm) of the edges.
4 Gently press the apricot halves, cut
side up, on the pastry in rows, leaving
a 1⁄2in (1cm) margin all around the
outside.
5 Scatter the almonds over the
apricots. Sprinkle with the Amaretto
and then the sugar. Place a dot of
butter in each apricot cavity.
6 Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce
the heat to 400°F (200°C). Bake for
another 20 minutes, or until the
pastry and apricots are glazed and
golden brown.

BABA GANOUSH
No Middle Eastern mezze table is
complete without this creamy dip.
Serve with warm strips of pita bread.
CLASSIC RECIPE
Round green eggplant
Sometimes called apple eggplant,
this has a firm, crisp texture and
agreeable mildly bitter flavor. Slice
into segments and use in curry
dishes or raw in Asian-style salads.
Italian round eggplant
Prosperosa, a widely available variety, has
non-bitter, smooth-textured flesh that retains
its shape when cooked. The squat, round
shape lends itself to stuffing and baking.
Thai pea eggplant
A miniature green variety, this has a slightly bitter flavor and
crisp texture. The high seed-to-flesh ratio makes the eggplants
pleasantly crunchy, and they do not soften with cooking.
East Asian purple eggplant
The long, narrow, purple-green eggplant
is mild-flavored and sweet and uniform
in size.
SERVES 6
2lb (900g) eggplants, cut in half lengthwise
2 large garlic cloves, crushed
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 tbsp plain yogurt
3–4 tbsp tahini*
2–3 tbsp fresh lemon juice
salt and freshly ground black pepper
coarsely chopped cilantro, for garnish
1 Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C)
and lightly grease a baking sheet.
Score the flesh of each eggplant half,
without cutting through the skin, then
place cut-side down on the baking
sheet. Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until
the flesh is softened and collapsing.
2 Transfer the eggplant halves to
a colander and leave to cool for about
15 minutes.
3 Scoop the eggplant flesh into a food
processor or blender; discard the skin.
Add the garlic, olive oil, yogurt, 3 tbsp
tahini, and 2 tbsp lemon juice, and
process until smooth. Taste and add
more tahini and lemon juice, if you
like, then season with salt and pepper.
4 Scoop into a bowl and sprinkle with
cilantro before serving.

2 lb (1kg) cardoons
salt and freshly ground black pepper
juice of 1 lemon
2 tbsp butter

Melt the butter in a small saucepan,
then remove from the heat and stir
in the flour. Return to the heat and
cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Gradually
stir in the milk. Cook, stirring, until
smooth and thickened. Remove from
the heat, season with salt and pepper,
and stir in half the Parmesan. Pour
evenly over the cardoons and sprinkle
with the remaining Parmesan.
3 Bake uncovered for 20–25 minutes,
or until golden and bubbling. Serve

BASIC PILAF
A simple, savory accompaniment to
chicken, fish, and vegetable dishes.
The secret to fluffy rice is to rinse the
grains of excess starch, then boil
without stirring, and leave to steam
briefly off the heat before serving.
SERVES 4
1 cup long grain white rice
1½ tbsp unsalted butter or 1 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1½ cups chicken or vegetable stock, heated

finely chopped fresh tarragon leaves or a
mixture of tarragon and chervil
freshly ground white pepper
12 tbsp (1½ sticks) unsalted butter
3 large egg yolks
salt
1 Combine the wine, vinegar, shallots,
tarragon sprigs, and a good grinding
of pepper in a small, heavy,
nonreactive saucepan. Cook
over low heat, uncovered, until
the liquid has reduced to 2–3
tbsp. Strain through a fine sieve,
pressing the shallots and tarragon well
to extract maximum flavor. Discard
the shallots and tarragon.
2 Return the liquid to the pan. Melt
the butter gently and set aside. When
the butter has cooled to lukewarm,
discard the white residue on top. Set
the melted butter aside.
3 Set the pan with the wine and
vinegar reduction over very low heat
and whisk in the egg yolks and a little
salt. Add the melted butter, a
tablespoon or so at a time, whisking
continuously. Wait until each spoonful
is absorbed before adding more
butter. Remove the pan from the heat
before adding the final spoonful. Add
the tarragon leaves and taste, adding
more salt and pepper if needed. The
sauce can be kept warm for about
15 minutes in a bowl placed over

1 x ¼oz (7g) envelope active dry yeast
1 cup buckwheat flour
1 cup bread flour
3 eggs, separated
1 tsp superfine or granulated sugar

are ready to cook the blini, whisk the
egg whites in a clean bowl until stiff
peaks form; then fold them into the
risen batter.
4 Heat a large, heavy-bottomed frying
pan or griddle over medium heat.
When thoroughly hot, grease lightly
with butter and pour spoonfuls of
batter onto the pan or griddle, making
blini about 2–3in (5–8cm) diameter.
Cook until small bubbles appear on
the surface, then flip and cook on the
other side until golden brown. Keep
the blini warm in a low oven while
you cook the remaining batter.

1 cup mayonnaise
½ cup sour cream
3 tbsp milk
1 tbsp cider vinegar
1 small garlic clove, crushed through
a press
1 cup crumbled blue cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper

batter should be fairly wet and
lumpy. Take care not to overmix.
Fold in the blueberries.
4 Divide the batter equally among
the paper muffin cups. Bake for about
20 minutes, or until the muffins are
firm, risen, and golden brown. A

BUCKWHEAT GALETTES
Although "galette" often refers
to a free-form pie or tart, it can
also describe a savory buckwheat
crêpe. These are popular in Brittany,
in northwest France, where the
local cuisine is defined by rich,
rustic flavors.
SERVES 4
½ cup buckwheat flour
½ cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup whole milk
sunflower or canola oil, for frying, plus
extra for greasing the pan
2 small red onions, thinly sliced
8oz (200g) smoked ham, chopped
1 tsp fresh thyme leaves
4oz (115g) Brie, cut into small pieces
½ cup crème fraîche
1 Sift the flours into a large mixing
bowl, make a well in the center and
add the eggs. Gradually beat the eggs
into the flour using a wooden spoon,
then add the milk and 1/2 cup water to
make a smooth batter. Cover and leave
to stand for 2 hours.
2 Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the
onions and cook gently until softened.
Stir in the ham and thyme, then remove
the pan from the heat and set aside.
3 Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).
Heat a crêpe pan or small frying
pan and grease it lightly. Spoon in
2 tbsp of the batter and swirl the
pan so it coats the bottom. Cook
for about 1 minute, or until lightly
browned underneath, then flip over
and cook for another minute, or
until browned on the other side.
Make 7 more crêpes in this way,
regreasing the pan as necessary.
4 Stir the Brie and crème fraîche into
the ham mixture and divide the mix
among the 8 crêpes. Roll or fold up the

CALDERETA ASTURIANA
This iconic fish stew from the
Asturias region of Spain uses any
fish that is landed on the day.
SERVES 6
21⁄4lb (1kg) white fish (e.g. hake,
monkfish, red mullet), filleted and skinned
4 small squid, prepared
8oz (250g) shrimp, peeled and deveined
1lb (450g) each mussels and clams,
prepared
⅔ cup dry white wine
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
large pinch of cayenne pepper
1 heaping tablespoon all-purpose flour
1¼ cup fish stock or bottled clam juice
and water, or more as needed
1 large bunch parsley, chopped
(about ½ to ⅔ cup)
2 large red bell peppers, seeded and
quartered lengthwise
salt and freshly ground black pepper
fresh lemon juice to taste
1 Heat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Cut the fish fillets into large pieces,
and the squid into large squares.
Refrigerate until needed.
2 Discard any mussels or clams that
remain open when tapped. Pour the
wine into a soup pot, bring to a boil
and simmer for 1 minute. Add the
mussels and clams and cook over
medium heat for 3–4 minutes, or until
they have opened. Discard any that do
not open. Strain the cooking juices and
reserve. Remove the cooked mussels
and clams from their shells and reserve.
3 Heat the oil in a large flameproof
casserole, add the onion and cook for
1–2 minutes, or until beginning to
soften. Add the garlic, cayenne, and
flour; stir over medium heat for 1–2
minutes. Add the reserved mussel and
clam juices, fish stock, and parsley.
Season lightly.
4 Add the raw seafood to the casserole,
along with the peppers. The fish should
be submerged in the liquid from the
sauce: if it isn’t, add a little extra stock
or water. Cover tightly and cook in the
oven for 20–25 minutes, or until all the
fish is cooked through and opaque.
Add the cooked mussels and clams,
and return to the oven for a further 5
minutes, or until hot. Sprinkle with
lemon juice and serve with chunks of
warm, crusty bread.

water for 3–4 minutes. Drain and stir
into the potato broth with the olive oil.
Simmer for 1–2 minutes. Season to
taste and serve hot.

CAMEMBERT EN BOÎTE
Baking cheese in its own package is
a great innovation; but you will need
cheese that comes in a wooden box
rather than cardboard. The vermouth
and thyme add delicious aromas.
SERVES 2–4
1 8-to 9-ounce (250g) wheel of
Camembert in its wooden box
1 garlic clove, halved
2 tsp white vermouth or dry white wine
1 tsp olive oil
2 tsp chopped fresh thyme
freshly ground black pepper
French bread, heated
1 Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
Unwrap the cheese and rub the
surface with the garlic; discard the
garlic. Return the cheese (unwrapped)
to the box. Set it on a baking sheet.
2 Make small holes all over the top of
the cheese with a skewer. Carefully
drizzle with the vermouth and oil,
spreading them out with a spoon.
3 Sprinkle with the thyme and season
with pepper. Replace the lid of the
box. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the
cheese is soft and melted in the center.
4 Remove the lid, set the open box
on a heatproof plate, and place in the
center of the table. Serve immediately
with chunks of warm, crusty French
bread for dipping (eat the crust, too).

CAPER BUTTER
A classic flavored butter, which is
great to serve as an accompaniment
to fish or barbecued meat.
MAKES ABOUT 1⁄2 CUP
8 tbsp (one stick) butter, softened
1 tbsp capers, rinsed if salted, chopped
juice of ½ lemon (optional)
1 Add the butter to a small bowl and,
using a wooden spoon, beat it until
creamy. Add the capers and continue
beating until combined. Gradually
beat in the lemon juice, if using.
2 Spoon the mixture onto a small
sheet of parchment or wax paper and
roll into a sausage shape, securing the
edges. Refrigerate and leave to harden,
then cut off slices as needed. Freeze
for longer storage.

CARAMEL SAUCE
Caramel has been used as a flavoring
since sugar was first crystallized.
This sauce appears in 19th-century
European cookbooks as a topping for
ice cream and other desserts.
MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP
1¼ cups superfine or granulated sugar
4 tbsp water
4 tbsp salted butter, cut into pieces
⅔ cup heavy whipping cream
1 Mix together the sugar and water in
a deep-sided, heavy-bottomed
saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring
constantly, until the sugar has
completely dissolved. Continue
cooking for 4-5 minutes without
stirring, until the resulting caramel
becomes a rich amber color.
2 Remove the pan from the heat and
whisk in the butter and the cream.
Place the pan over low heat and gently
bring to a boil, stirring constantly,
until the sauce is smooth. Cool for a
few minutes before serving warm.

CARAWAY SOUP
A really tasty twist on vegetable soup,
and lovely served with crusty bread
and butter. The recipe is easy and
produces a thick soup, which may
need to be thinned with a little water.
SERVES 4
2 tbsp butter
1 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 celery ribs, thinly diced
2 carrots, cut into fine dice
1–2 tsp caraway seeds, to taste
3 medium russet or other floury baking
potatoes, peeled and diced
4 cups hot vegetable or chicken stock
Handful of curly parsley, finely chopped,
for garnish (optional)
1 Combine the butter and the oil in
a large saucepan. Once the butter has
melted, add the onion and a pinch of
salt. Cook over low heat for about 5
minutes or until soft and translucent.
Stir in the garlic, celery, and carrots
and cook gently for about 10 minutes
until the carrots begin to soften.
2 Stir in the caraway seeds to taste,
then add the potatoes and stir. Season
with pepper and a little more salt if
needed. Pour in the hot stock and
bring to a boil, then reduce the heat
and simmer for 15–20 minutes until
the potatoes are soft. Let cool for a
few minutes.
3 Working in batches, puree the
mixture in a blender or food
processor until smooth; if too thick,
add a little hot water. Return the
soup to a clean pot and reheat over
low heat; taste, and adjust the
seasonings if needed. Just before
serving, sprinkle with parsley.

CARROT CAKE
Top this moist cake with a traditional
cream cheese frosting, or simply dust
it with powdered sugar.
CLASSIC RECIPE

1 cup golden raisins
For the frosting
8oz (225g) cream cheese
5 tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 tsp vanilla extract
1lb (450g) confectioners’ sugar, sifted
finely grated zest of 1 orange
1 Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Grease a 13 x 9in (30 x 23cm) baking
pan and line with parchment paper.
Stir together the flour, sugar, baking
soda, baking powder, spices, and salt.
2 Beat together the oil and eggs, then
stir them into the flour mixture until
just combined. Add the carrots,
walnuts, and raisins and mix well.
3 Pour the mixture into the pan and
spread evenly. Bake for 30–35 minutes
or until a knife inserted in the center
comes out clean. Cool in the pan.
4 To make the frosting, beat the cream

with an electric mixer until smooth.
Gradually beat in the sugar. Fold in
the orange zest with a spatula. Spread
the frosting over the top of the cooled
cake. Cut into squares to serve.

CHAR-GRILLED SWORDFISH
Meaty fish—including swordfish,
tuna, and marlin—are best chargrilled
on an indoor grill pan or
barbecued outdoors, rather than
simply broiled. Fish steaks need
intense heat in order to char
the exterior.
SERVES 2
2 x 5oz (140g) swordfish steaks (around
1in/2½cm- thick is best)
olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper,
to serve
1 Preheat a dry, well-seasoned grill
pan until it is just beginning to
smoke. Meanwhile, brush the
swordfish lightly with olive oil and
season with salt and pepper.
2 Gently press each fish steak onto the
hot grill with a metal spatula. Allow
to cook for 1–2 minutes, or until the
steak will lift cleanly off the grill. (If it
remains stuck to the grill, leave in to
cook for another few seconds and try
again.) Flip the steaks over and press
flat with the spatula as before. Cook
for another 1–2 minutes, or until they
will lift cleanly from the pan. Reduce
the heat and turn the steaks back onto
the first side, trying to position them
so that the char-grill marks are at a
perpendicular angle to those made
during the first cooking. Cook for
1 minute before turning onto the
second side, again at an angle.
3 Avoid turning the steaks a third
time, in order to prevent disturbing
the existing grill marks. Cook until
the steaks are opaque and firm to the
touch. Leave to rest for 1 minute
before serving. Serve with a simple
salad or a flavored butter

CHAT MASALA
The amchoor adds a tart and slightly
sour flavor to this masala spice mix;
use it in small quantities sprinkled
over fruit and vegetable salads.
1 tbsp coriander seeds
2 tsp cumin seeds
2 tsp fennel seeds
5 cardamom pods, seeds only
5 small dried red chile peppers, each cut
into pieces, stems and seeds discarded
1 tbsp amchoor (mango powder, available
at Indian markets or specialty spice shops)
1 tbsp garam masala
1 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp asafoetida powder (available at
Indian markets or specialty spice shops)
1 In a small dry frying pan, warm
the coriander, cumin, fennel, and
cardamom seeds over low heat,
stirring, until fragrant. Put them in
a spice grinder or pound in a mortar
and pestle.
2 Place the chiles in the dry skillet
and heat them for about 2 minutes,
stirring, being careful not to burn
them. Leave to cool slightly, so they
crisp up a bit, then add to the spice
grinder and pulse once or twice.
3 Now add the armchoor, garam
masala, ginger, and asafoetida to the
grinder. Grind or pound into a well
blended powder. Store in an airtight
container for up to 2 months.

CHÂTEAUBRIAND WITH BÉARNAISE
This simple yet superb dish
was created for the 18th-century
politician Châteaubriand in
Napoleonic France.
SERVES 2
1lb (450g) Châteaubriand (beef fillet,
center cut)
salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 tbsp butter
2 tbsp olive oil
For the béarnaise sauce
½ cup dry white wine
2 tbsp white wine vinegar
1 shallot, finely chopped
1 tbsp chopped tarragon
2 egg yolks
8 tbsp (1 stick) butter, cubed
1 Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C).
2 First make the sauce. Combine the
wine, wine vinegar, shallot, and half
of the tarragon in a small nonreactive
saucepan or frying pan and boil until
reduced to 2 tbsp. Pour this into a
heatproof bowl set over a pan of
barely simmering water. Whisk in the
egg yolks, then add the butter one
piece at a time, stirring constantly as
it melts and before adding the next
piece of butter. Continue until all
the butter has been incorporated
and the the sauce thickens; stir
constantly. If the sauce curdles, beat
in a few drops of water. Immediately
remove from the heat and strain the
sauce through a sieve. Add the
reserved tarragon, and season lightly
with salt and pepper. Keep warm.
3 Season the beef all over with the salt
and pepper. Heat the butter and oil in
a heavy frying pan with an ovenproof
handle. When the butter stops
foaming, add the beef and brown
briefly but well on both sides.
4 Transfer the frying pan to the oven
and roast the meat until cooked to the
desired doneness, about 8–10 minutes
for medium rare, depending on the
thickness of the meat. Remove from the
oven and allow to rest in a warm place,
loosely covered, for 5 to 7 minutes.
5 Slice the beef across the grain and
serve with the warm béarnaise sauce.

CHEESE SAUCE
A basic cheese sauce is a cook’s
classic mainstay for serving with
fish, vegetables, or pasta.
MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP
1½ tbsp butter
1½ tbsp all-purpose flour
1 cup milk, heated
1⁄2 tsp Dijon mustard (optional)
½ to ¾ cup shredded sharp Cheddar
cheese or other flavorful semi-hard cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 Melt the butter in a small heavy or
nonstick saucepan. Stir in the flour
and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.
2 Remove from the heat and gradually
stir in the milk until smooth. Return
to the heat, bring to a boil, and cook
for 2 minutes, stirring all the time,
until thick, smooth, and glossy.
3 Stir in the mustard, if using, and
cheese to taste. Season with salt and
pepper. Use as required.

CHEESE SOUFFLÉ
Soufflés are not challenging at all,
and are actually quite easy. Once
you master this soufflé, there are
many options beyond the basic
cheese version.
SERVES 4
1 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan
3 tbsp butter, plus extra for greasing the
soufflé dish
3 tbsp all-purpose flour
1 cup whole milk, heated
salt and freshly ground pepper
1 cup shredded Cheddar or Gruyère cheese
1⁄2 tsp Dijon mustard
4 large eggs, separated, plus 1 large egg
white, at room temperature
1 Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
Butter the bottom and sides of a 6-cup
soufflé dish, and dust evenly with
the Parmesan cheese.
2 Melt the butter in a saucepan over
medium heat. Whisk in the flour and
cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes.
Gradually whisk in the milk and bring
to a boil, whisking constantly, until
thickened and smooth.
3 Remove the pan from the heat. Stir
in the cheese and mustard and season
with salt and pepper. Add the egg
yolks to the cheese mixture one at a
time, stirring each until blended before
adding the next.
4 In a large, clean bowl, beat the egg
whites until stiff peaks form. (The
whites should still be glossy; do not
overbeat.) Stir about one-fourth of the
whites into the cheese mixture, then
fold in the remaining whites.
5 Pour the cheese mixture into the
prepared soufflé dish and sprinkle the
Parmesan over the top. Place the dish
on the hot baking sheet in the oven
and bake for 25–30 minutes, or until
the soufflé is puffed and golden brown
on top. Serve at once.

CHEESE STRAWS
A popular 18th-century appetizer,
these crunchy fingers were later
served as a savory after a formal
dinner or as a supper snack.
MAKES ABOUT 45
1 cup all-purpose flour
1⁄2 tsp celery salt
large pinch of cayenne pepper
4 tbsp butter, cut in small pieces
¾ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
(or other flavorful semi-hard cheese)
1 egg, beaten
1 Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
2 Put the flour in a bowl and stir in
the celery salt and cayenne. Add the
butter and rub in with your fingertips
until the mixture resembles coarse
crumbs. Stir in the cheese.
3 Mix in enough of the beaten egg
to bind to a stiff dough. On a lightly
floured work surface, gently knead
the dough into a smooth ball free
from cracks; then roll into a rectangle
about 1⁄4 in (5 mm) thick. Trim away
and reserve any ragged edges.
4 Cut the rectangle into strips about
4 in (10 cm) wide, and then
crosswise into ½ in (1 cm)
strips. Using a metal
spatula, carefully transfer the
strips on to lightly greased
baking sheets, placing about
1 inch apart. Roll out the
trimmings into another
triangle and cut more strips.
5 Bake for about 15 minutes, or until
lightly golden and cooked through.
Leave to cool on the baking sheets for
about 5 minutes before serving, or
transfer to a wire rack to cool completely
and store in an airtight container.

CHERRY PIE
Cherry pie is an all-American favorite
that can be made with either sweet or
sour cherries. This double-crust
version uses sweet Bing cherries.
SERVES 6
For the pastry
5 tbsp cold butter, cut into pieces
5 tbsp lard, cut into pieces
2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted with
a pinch of salt
milk and superfine or granulated sugar,
to glaze
For the filling
3 tbsp demerara (raw) sugar
1½lbs (750g) Bing cherries, pitted
1 tbsp cornstarch
1⁄2 tsp ground cinnamon
2 drops almond extract
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
1 egg white, lightly beaten
with 1 tbsp water
2 tbsp cold butter, cut into pieces
1 Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
Make the pastry by rubbing the butter
and lard into the flour until the mixture
resembles coarse crumbs; then work in
2–3 tbsp ice water until the mixture just
holds together. Wrap in plastic and
refrigerate for 30 minutes.
2 In a saucepan, dissolve the demerara
sugar in 1 cup (300ml) water, then boil
rapidly for 3–4 minutes to make a syrup.
Stir the cherries into the syrup and cook
just until the mixture reaches a boil.
Drain the cherries and allow to cool.
3 In a bowl, gently mix together the
cherries, cornstarch, cinnamon, almond
extract, and lemon juice.
4 Roll out two-thirds of the pastry on
a well-floured surface and use to line a
9in (23cm) round greased pie plate.
Brush the entire pastry with the
egg-white mixture to prevent a soggy
crust. Spoon in the cherry mixture and
dot with the butter.
5 Roll out the remaining pastry and lay
it over the cherries. Trim the pastry so it
hangs about 3⁄4in (2cm) over the edge of
the pan. Moisten the edges of the pastry,
then press together lightly and fold
under to seal. Crimp the edge
decoratively. Cut several small vents in
the top crust so steam can escape. Brush
with milk and dust with the sugar.
6 Place the pie plate on a baking sheet
(to catch any drips) and bake for 30–40
minutes, or until the crust is golden
brown. Cool on a wire rack before
serving warm or at room temperature.

CHICKEN KIEV
This classic dish of chicken stuffed
with a garlic butter was given its name
by Russian immigrants in France.
SERVES 4
8 tbsp (1 stick) butter, softened
2 garlic cloves, crushed through a press
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
finely grated zest of 1 lemon
salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 skinless boneless chicken breast halves
3 tbsp all-purpose flour
1 large egg, beaten
1½ cups fresh bread crumbs
vegetable oil, for deep-frying
1 Combine the butter, garlic, parsley,
and lemon zest in a bowl. Season with
salt and pepper. Spoon onto a sheet of
plastic wrap and shape into a 3 x 2in
(7 x 5cm) rectangle. Wrap and
refrigerate for 2 hours, or until very firm.
2 Working with 1 at a time, pound the
chicken breasts between two sheets of
plastic wrap to an even thickness of
about ¼in (5mm). Season with salt and
pepper. Cut the garlic butter lengthwise
into four equal sticks and place one on
each chicken breast. Fold in 2 sides; roll
to enclose the butter completely.
3 Season the flour with salt and pepper.
Dredge each chicken parcel in flour; dip
in beaten egg, and, finally, coat evenly
with bread crumbs. Take care to keep
the chicken wrapped around the butter.
4 Heat a deep pan of oil to 350°F
(180°C). Cook the chicken for 6–8
minutes, or until golden brown. Drain
on paper towels and serve hot.

CINNAMON ROLLS
These sweetly spiced rolls are much
lighter than you might imagine, and
are incredibly addictive. Especially
delicious served with hot chocolate!
MAKES 9
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra
3 tsp baking powder
salt
8 tbsp (1 stick) softened butter
1 cup whole milk
1⁄4 cup granulated sugar
2 tsp ground cinnamon
3 tbsp confectioners’ sugar, sieved
1 Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
Sift the flour and baking powder into
a large bowl and mix in a pinch of
salt. Add the 8 tbsp butter and rub
it in, using your fingertips.
2 Pour in the milk and use a knife
to pull the mixture together, then use
floured hands to turn the dough out
onto a floured work surface. Knead
gently, then roll out into a rectangle
about 16 x 10in (40 x 25cm).
3 Brush the dough with all of the
melted butter, then sprinkle the sugar
and cinnamon over the top, making
sure it reaches the edges. Roll up the
dough jellyroll fashion, and cut the
roll crosswise into 1¼in (3cm) slices.
Arrange cut-side down on a
parchment-lined baking sheet, and
bake for 15 minutes or until just
golden and cooked through. Remove
and cool on a wire rack.
4 Serve plain, or drizzle with icing. To
make the icing, mix the confectioners’
sugar with just enough water to be
somewhat thick, but still fluid enough
to fall from a spoon. Drizzle the icing
over the rolls and leave to set.

CORN CHOWDER
There are recipes for this thick, rich,
and chunky North American soup
dating back to the 1880s.
SERVES 4–6
4 fresh corn (corn on the cob)
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 bay leaves
2 tbsp olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
4 fresh sage leaves, chopped, or ½ tsp
dried sage
1 tsp chopped fresh thyme leaves,
or ½ tsp dried thyme
1 carrot, chopped
2 celery ribs, chopped
1 large russet or other floury baking
potato, peeled and chopped
½ cup milk
half-and-half and paprika, to garnish
1 Remove the husk and silk from the
ears of corn, then shave off the kernels
and scrape the “milk” from the cob
into a bowl. Set the kernels and “milk”
aside. Place the cobs in a large
saucepan and add 2 cups water, a
good pinch of salt, and the bay leaves.
Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat,
cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.
Remove and discard the cobs and bay
leaves. Reserve the stock.
2 Heat the olive oil in the rinsed-out
saucepan and cook the onion until
soft and translucent. Stir in the sage,
thyme, carrot, celery, and potato.
Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the
vegetables are starting to soften. Add
the reserved stock and continue to
simmer for about 10 minutes, or until
the potato is falling apart.
3 Meanwhile, put the corn kernels in
another saucepan and add just enough
cold water to cover. Bring to a boil
and cook for 2 minutes. Set aside.
4 Add the milk to the soup mixture,
then puree until smooth using a hand
(immersion) blender; or in batches in
a standard blender or food processor.
Add the corn kernels with their
cooking liquid and the corn “milk.” If
you like, quickly process the chowder
one more time with the blender to
break up the kernels slightly.
5 Reheat the chowder, and adjust the
seasonings if necessary. Ladle into
warm bowls, drizzle with half-andhalf,
and dust with a little paprika.
Serve hot.

juice to the saucepan and bring to a boil.
Stir in the sugar until dissolved.
3 Simmer for 10 minutes, then place a
spoonful on a saucer in the refrigerator
to test that the jelly has thickened and
reached the setting point. Ladle into
sterilized jars and refrigerate. (For longer
storage, seal the lids in a hot water bath,
according to canning instructions.) Store
the sealed jars for up to 1 year; once
opened, refrigerate for up to 3 weeks.

CRÈME ANGLAISE
A classic, rich French custard sauce,
made from egg yolks and milk, and
traditionally flavored with vanilla.
Serve with desserts.
MAKES ABOUT 1¼ CUPS
1¼ cups whole milk
1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
3 egg yolks
3 tbsp superfine or granulated sugar
1 tsp pure vanilla extract (optional)
1 Heat the milk and vanilla bean in a
saucepan until nearly boiling. Remove
the pan from the heat and leave for
10 minutes, to allow the flavor of the
vanilla to infuse the milk. Use the tip
of a small sharp knife to scrape the
vanilla seeds into the milk. Remove
the pod, rinse it, and let it dry
completely; then store in an airtight
container for future use.
2 Meanwhile, beat the yolks with
the sugar in a bowl. Whisk in the
hot milk, then return the mixture
to the pan.
3 Place the pan over medium–low
heat and simmer, stirring constantly
with a wooden spoon until the sauce
is just thick enough to coat the back
of the spoon. Do not allow the sauce
to boil once the egg yolks are added,
or the sauce will curdle.
4 Strain the sauce through a sieve into
a bowl and serve as needed. If using
vanilla extract, add it at this point. If
serving cold, stir occasionally to avoid
a skin from forming. Cover with
plastic wrap, pressing the plastic
directly onto the surface of the sauce,
and refrigerate for up to 2 days.

CRÈME BRÛLÉE
This popular French dessert consists
of a baked custard, topped with a
fine, crisp layer of caramelized sugar.
SERVES 6
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 vanilla bean, split in half lengthwise
5 egg yolks
¼ cup superfine sugar
12 tbsp granulated or raw sugar
1 Preheat the oven to 275°F (140°C).
Place the cream in a saucepan and add
the vanilla bean. Heat the cream over
low heat until just simmering, then set
aside to infuse for 1 hour.
2 Whisk the egg yolks and superfine
sugar together. Lift the vanilla bean
from the cream, and, scrape the seeds
into the cream. Whisk the cream into
the egg mixture, then strain through a
sieve. Pour the mixture into 6
ramekins or custard cups, and place
in a roasting pan. Add enough boiling
water to the pan to reach halfway up
the sides of the ramekins. Bake for 40
minutes, until just set. Once cooled,
refrigerate until fully chilled.
3 Before serving, sprinkle 2 tbsp
of the granulated sugar over each
custard. Place the ramekins under a
broiler and cook just until the sugar
melts and caramelizes. Let cool and
harden, then serve at once or
refrigerate for up to 1 hour.

CREME PATISSIERE
This sweet pastry cream is a rich and
custard-like filling for fruit tarts and
cream puffs.
CLASSIC RECIPE
MAKES ABOUT 1¼ CUPS
1¼ cups whole milk
2 egg yolks
¼ cup superfine or granulated sugar
3 tbsp all-purpose flour
3 tbsp cornstarch
¼ tsp pure vanilla extract
1 Pour the milk into a saucepan and
heat it to the simmering point; do not
let it boil.
2 Beat the egg yolks and sugar in a
bowl, mix in the flour and cornstarch,
then add the hot milk, and mix well.
3 Return the mixture to the pan and
slowly bring it to a boil, stirring
constantly, until it becomes smooth
and lump-free. Once the mixture
reaches the boiling point, immediately
reduce the heat, and simmer, stirring
for 1–2 minutes, to cook the flour.
4 Allow the mixture to cool a bit, then
stir in the vanilla extract. Use at once,
or cover and refrigerate until needed

CULLEN SKINK
Cullen Skink is named after Cullen,
in northeast Scotland. “Skink” is the
regional name for soup or stew. This
recipe is traditionally made with
Finnan haddock.
SERVES 4
2 whole finnan haddie (finnan haddock)
or 4 small smoked haddock fillets
1 onion, finely chopped
1 cup whole milk
1 large russet (8oz/225g) or other floury
potato, boiled, peeled, and mashed with
2 tbsp butter
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 Put the fish into a large sauté pan.
Pour in 1 cup of water and add the
onion. Poach the fish for 8–10
minutes, or until opague. Lift the fish
on to a plate and pull away the flakes
of flesh. Set aside. Return the bones to
the water and continue to cook for
another 15 minutes. Strain the stock
into a container. Recover as much of
the onion as possible from the sieve,
and stir in the strained stock, then stir
in the milk.
2 Return the stock mixture to the
pan and whisk in the mashed potato
to form a thick, creamy soup. Season
to taste and add the flaked fish.
Serve at once.

DEEP-FRIED CATFISH
Catfish, particularly in this delicious
dish, is a staple in the Midwestern
and Southern states of the US; and is
traditionally served with “slaw and
ketchup”. Other flavors, such as
jalapeño chile and Creole seasoning,
are often added to the cornmeal mix.
SERVES 4
4 x 6oz (175g) catfish fillets
1 cup whole milk
2⁄3 cup all-purpose flour
2⁄3 cup fine cornmeal or grits
salt and freshly ground black pepper
oil, for frying
lemon wedges, to garnish
1 Remove any bones from the catfish
fillets and rinse in the milk. Do not
pat dry. Sift the flour and cornmeal
on to a plate, and mix with salt and
pepper. Coat the fish on all sides.
2 Fill a frying pan one-third full with
oil. Heat until very hot, then, cook the
fish, turning once, until opaque on
the inside and golden on the outside.
Remove, blotting excess oil with paper
towels. Place on a warm serving plate,
and sprinkle with a little more salt.

DEEP-FRIED COD AND CHIPS
An all-time classic British dish.
Traditionally served with
tartar sauce.
SERVES 4
4 x 6oz (170g) cod fillets, skinned
⅔ cup all-purpose flour, plus 1 tbsp
a pinch of baking powder
pinch of salt, plus extra for seasoning
1 egg yolk
1 tbsp sunflower or canola oil
½ cup equal parts milk and water
21⁄4lbs (1kg) Maris Piper, russet, or other
floury baking potatoes, peeled and cut
into wedges
oil for deep frying
freshly ground black pepper
lemon wedges, to serve
1 Remove any small bones from the cod
fillets. Make the batter: sift the ⅔ cup
flour into a large bowl along with the
baking powder and a pinch of salt.
Make a well in the center and add the
egg yolk, oil, and a little of the
milk-and-water mixture. Stir the flour
into the liquid until smooth, adding the
remaining liquid mix as needed to
create a batter. Refrigerate for 10
minutes before use.
2 Soak the potatoes in cold water for
10 minutes, drain, and dry
thoroughly. Heat the oil in a deep-fat
fryer or large, heavy pot to 340°F
(170ºC). Working in batches, cook
the potatoes in the oil for a few
minutes until just tender; do not
brown. Drain on paper towels.
3 Increase the oil temperature to
350°F (180ºC). Season the remaining
1 tbsp flour with salt and pepper.
Dust the cod fillets with this; then,
working in batches as needed, dip
them into the batter, coating all sides.
Holding a cod fillet with tongs, swish
it around in the hot oil, then release
into the oil (this prevents the batter
from sticking to the fry basket). Cook
for 5-6 minutes or until the batter is a
deep golden brown. Lift onto a wire
rack, season lightly with salt, and
keep warm. Repeat with the
remaining fillets.
4 Working in batches, fry the
potatoes for a second time, to
allow them to brown. This will
take 2-3 minutes. Lift onto clean
paper towels to drain, sprinkle
lightly with salt, and then serve
alongside the deep-fried cod.

DRESSED CRAB
A quintessential English classic,
dressed crab is traditionally prepared
using brown edible crab. Dungeness
crab is a good alternative.
SERVES 2
1 large cooked crab in the shell, about
3lb (1.5kg)
splash of oil
2–3 tbsp fresh white bread crumbs
English mustard powder, such as Colman’s
cayenne pepper
Worcestershire sauce
freshly ground black pepper
1 hard-boiled egg, for garnish
chopped parsley
1 Remove the meat from the crab and
set aside. This is done by cracking the
claws with a mallet and splitting the
main body of the crab with a knife
and digging out meat from the shell.
Discard the claw shells, cartilage,
stomach, sac, and gills.
2 Rinse the shell well and brush with
a little oil. Mix the crabmeat with
enough bread crumbs to allow to
bind. Season with salt and pepper and
add other seasonings to taste.
3 Mound the crabmeat mixture back
in the cleaned shell and garnish with
chopped hard-boiled egg white,
sieved hard-boiled egg yolks and
chopped parsley.

DUCK CONFIT
From Gascony in France, this uses a
time-honored method of preserving
meat by salting and then cooking it
in its own fat.
SERVES 4
4 duck legs
6oz (175g) coarse sea salt
4 garlic cloves, crushed
1oz (30g) white peppercorns
1 tsp coriander seeds
5 juniper berries
1 tbsp chopped fresh thyme
2¼lbs (1kg) duck or goose fat, heated
until liquid and then cooled slightly
1 Dry the duck legs on paper towels.
Pound the salt, garlic, peppercorns,
coriander seeds, juniper berries, and
thyme in a large mortar and pestle to
make a coarse paste. Alternatively,
process in a food processor. Rub this
mixture into the skin of the duck legs,
then arrange them in a single layer,
skin-side down, in a non-metallic
dish. Cover with plastic wrap and
refrigerate for 12 hours.
2 Preheat the oven to 275°F (140°C).
Rinse the duck well and pat dry, then
place the pieces side by side in a
baking dish just large enough to hold
them in a single layer. Spoon the duck
fat over the legs.
3 Place in the oven to cook for 1½
hours, or until the duck is very tender
when tested in the thickest part with
the pointed tip of a knife.
4 Transfer the duck legs to a plastic
container. Ladle the fat over the duck
through a fine sieve, being careful not
to scoop up any of the juices from the
bottom of the dish. Be sure the meat
is covered with at least 1in (2.5cm) of
fat. Leave to cool, then transfer the
duck and fat to a crock, large glass
jars, or freezer bags. Seal and
refrigerate until needed.
5 When ready to serve, remove the
duck legs from the fat and sauté or
broil, turning occasionally, until well
browned and heated through. Duck
fat can be heated and strained, and
refrigerated or frozen in an airtight
container for future use.

DUCK IN ORANGE SAUCE
A superb French classic of rich duck
with a bitter orange sauce, this was
originally made with wild duck, but
works well with domestic duck.
SERVES 4
4 tbsp butter
½ cup all-purpose flour
4 cups game or chicken stock, heated
1 x Long Island duck, weighing about
4½ lbs (2kg)
2 Seville (bitter) oranges
¼ cup granulated sugar
3 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 Melt the butter in a large saucepan.
When it turns golden brown, stir in
the flour. Gradually whisk in the stock
until smooth. Bring to a boil, then
reduce the heat and simmer for about
1 hour or until reduced by half.
2 Meanwhile, preheat the oven to
400°F (200°C). Prick the skin of the
duck all over with a fork and season
with salt. Place breast-side down on a
rack in a roasting pan. Roast for 30
minutes. Pour the fat from the pan,
turn the duck over, and roast for
another 1 hour. Remove from the
oven and, when cool enough to
handle, remove the legs and breasts.
Set aside in a warm place.
3 Use a vegetable peeler to remove the
thin orange skin off the oranges and
cut it into fine strips. (Do not cut into
the bitter white pith.) Blanch the
orange strips in boiling water for 5
minutes, then drain; reserve the zest.
Squeeze the juice from the oranges.
4 Heat the sugar in a small saucepan
until it melts and begins to caramelize.
Carefully add the vinegar (with
caution, as it can sputter and splash)
and dissolve the caramel—this takes a
few minutes. Add to the thickened
stock together with the orange juice
and stir to mix. Add most of the strips
of orange zest.
5 Warm the duck pieces gently in the
orange sauce, being careful not to
overcook the duck. Cut the breast
meat across the grain into diagonal
slices, if desired. Garnish with the
remaining orange zest before serving.

FOLDED OMELET
This iconic French egg dish is a
quick meal and can be flavored with
many different ingredients.
CLASSIC RECIPE
SERVES 1
10in (25cm) non-stick frying pan
(measured across the top)
3 eggs
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 to 2 tbsp butter, to taste
1 In a bowl, gently beat the eggs with a
fork until the yolks and whites are well
blended. Season to taste.
2 Melt the butter in the frying pan

GRAVLAX
This Nordic dish was originally
made by burying the salt-coated fish
in the ground.
SERVES 8–10
1 cup coarse sea salt
½ cup granulated sugar
1 tbsp white peppercorns, crushed
large bunch dill, chopped
2 tbsp vodka or brandy
2 x 2¼lbs (1kg) center-cut salmon fillets
with skin on, picked over to remove any
small bones
3 tbsp Dijon mustard
2 tsp granulated sugar
1 egg yolk
½ cup sunflower or canola oil
1 tbsp lemon juice
3 tbsp chopped dill
1 Mix together the salt, sugar,
peppercorns, dill, and vodka. Put ¼

one fillet, skin-side down, cover it
with most of the remaining cure, and
place the other fillet on top, skin-side
up. Spread the rest of the cure on top.
2 Cover with plastic wrap and weight
down with a heavy plate. Refrigerate
for 18 (or up to 48) hours, turning the
fish once or twice during this time.
3 Wipe the cure from the salmon;
slice it thinly on the diagonal. Discard
the skin. The fish will keep covered in
the refrigerator for 5 to 6 days.
4 To make the sauce, whisk the
mustard and sugar into the egg yolk.
Gradually beat in the oil. Stir in the
lemon juice and dill. Use at once, or
refrigerate up to 3 days.

GRILLED HALIBUT WITH BEURRE BLANC
Halibut has delicate flesh that is low
in fat. Simple preparations like this
suit its texture and flavor well.
SERVES 2
2 x 5oz (140g) halibut steaks
8 tbsp (1 stick) unsalted butter plus a
little melted butter or oil for brushing
1 shallot, finely chopped
5 tbsp fish stock or bottled clam juice
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper
fresh lemon juice, to taste
fresh chopped dill to garnish
1 Preheat the broiler to its highest
setting, or heat a grill pan over high
heat. Brush the halibut steaks all over
with the melted butter. Cook, turning
once, for 6–8 minutes, or until the
fish is lightly browned on the outside
and opaque throughout
2 To make the beurre blanc, cut the
unsalted butter into small chunks.
Melt 2 tbsp in a small saucepan, add
the shallot and cook over low heat,
stirring, for 2–3 minutes, or until soft.
Add the fish stock and vinegar, bring
to a boil and simmer until the liquid
has reduced to about 3 tbsp. Turn the
heat very low and add the remaining
butter, a few pieces at time, whisking
vigorously between each addition. It is
important to keep the stock hot, but
do not allow it to boil. Once all the
butter has been added, the sauce
should be creamy and fairly thick.
Remove from the heat, season, and
add lemon juice to taste.
3 Lift the grilled halibut onto a serving
plate and drizzle with the beurre
blanc. Garnish with dill and serve.

HARISSA
This fiery chile sauce is found
throughout North Africa, but it is
especially popular in Tunisia. It is
usually made with dried chiles.
Harissa is used as a cooking
ingredient, and as a condiment with
eggs, couscous, and tagines.
If you prefer to make harissa with
fresh chiles, substitute the same
quantity as dried, and omit the
soaking in Step 1.
SERVES 4–6
3½oz (100g) dried chiles
2 garlic cloves, peeled
½ tsp salt
1 tsp caraway seeds, crushed
½ tsp ground cumin
olive oil

the seeds and stems. Soak the flesh
in almost-boiling water for about
30 minutes, until soft. Meanwhile,
crush the garlic with the salt in a
mortar and pestle.
2 Drain the chiles and crush them in
the mortar, or in a small food
processor. Add the caraway seeds and
cumin, crushing to blend. Add 1–2
tbsp olive oil, or more, to lubricate the
mixture as needed. Transfer the chile
mixture to a small jar and cover with a
layer of olive oil. Use at once, or screw
on the lid and refrigerate for 3–4
weeks. Return to room temperature
before using.
3 Harissa is usually thinned with more
oil and lemon juice, water, or a few
spoonsful of hot stock from the dish
with which it is served.

A British favorite, serve this hot for
one meal and use the leftovers in
salads, sandwiches, and soups.
SERVES 10–12
6½lb (3kg) smoked half-ham on the
bone, skin-on
2 celery ribs, coarsely chopped
2 carrots, coarsely chopped
1 onion, coarsely chopped

in a piece of muslin or cheesecloth
a handful of extra cloves
4 tbsp runny honey
11⁄2 tbsp prepared hot or Dijon mustard
1 Place the ham, celery, carrots, onion,
and bouquet garni in a large pot, and
cover with cold water. Bring to a boil,
then reduce the heat and simmer
uncovered for about 1¾ hours.
2 Lift the ham onto a board and
discard the vegetables and cooking
liquid. Preheat the oven to
350°F (180°C).
3 Cut the skin off the ham, leaving a
smooth layer of fat. Score the fat with
a sharp knife, first in one direction
and then in the opposite direction, to
make a diamond pattern.

and refrigerate, covered,
for up to 1 week.

HONEYCOMB
Sometimes called sponge candy or
hokey pokey, this recipe appeared in
North America in the 19th century.
21⁄2 cups superfine or granulated sugar
1 cup water
4 tbsp golden syrup (such as Lyle’s)* or
light corn syrup
2 tsp baking soda, sifted for lumps
1 Line a baking sheet with oiled
parchment paper and set aside.
Combine the sugar, water, and syrup
in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan.
Cook over medium heat, stirring

minutes. Uncover and boil without
stirring until the temperature reaches
290°F (145°C) on a candy thermometer
and the mixture turns golden.
3 Remove from the heat. Stir in the
baking soda just until incorporated. The
mixture will bubble vigorously and pull
away from the sides of the pan.
4 Quickly pour it onto the prepared
sheet. Do not pat or spread it. You do
not want the bubbles to deflate.
5 Leave uncovered until it is room
temperature, completely set, and
easily breaks into bite-sized pieces.
Store in an airtight container.

floral fragrance of lavender.
SERVES 6–8
1 cup whole milk
4 dried lavender heads (to
yield about 1 tsp petals)
4 large egg yolks
½ cup superfine sugar
1 cup heavy cream, lightly
whipped
1 Pour the milk into a small
nonreactive saucepan. Pull off
lavender flowers and shake the petals
into the milk. Heat until bubbles
begin to appear around the edge of
the pan. Remove from the heat, cover,
and set aside to infuse for 30 minutes.
2 Strain the milk through a nylon
sieve and pour back into the clean
pan. Combine the egg yolks and sugar
in a bowl and whisk until well
blended. Warm the milk again as
before, then gradually whisk it into
the egg mixture. Return to the pan
and simmer over low heat, stirring
constantly, for 15–20 minutes, or until
the custard mixture thickens enough
to coat the back of a spoon. Do not
allow it to boil. Leave to cool, or cover
and refrigerate up to 24 hours.
3 Stir the cream into the custard, then
pour into an ice-cream maker and

directions. Once softly set, transfer the
ice cream to a covered container and
freeze until firm enough to scoop, at
least 3 hours or overnight. This ice
cream is best eaten within a week.

LEMON SORBET
Lemon sorbet is an international
classic; light and refreshing at the
end of a meal, or to cleanse the
palate between courses.
MAKES ABOUT 3½ CUPS
6 large lemons, preferably unwaxed, rinsed
1¼ cups granulated sugar
1 large egg white
1 Use a vegetable peeler to remove the
peel thinly in strips from 3 of the
lemons. Make sure you don’t take any
white pith or the sorbet will be bitter.
2 Put the sugar, lemon peel strips, and
1 cup water in a saucepan and bring
to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes to make a
syrup. Remove from the heat and
leave to cool.
3 Squeeze the juice from all of the
lemons and pour into a 2-cup liquid
measuring cup. Add enough water to
make a total of 1¾ cups liquid. Mix with
the syrup. Cover and chill overnight.
4 Strain the mixture into an ice cream
maker and freeze according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. When the
sorbet mixture starts to look icy, lightly
beat the egg white just to loosen it.
With the ice cream maker running, add
the egg white to the canister. When the
sorbet is firm, transfer to a covered
container and place in the freezer until
ready to serve.
5 If not using an ice cream maker, pour
the mixture into a container, cover, and
freeze for 1–2 hours, or until about 1in
(2.5cm) of the mixture is frozen around
the edges. Whisk to break up the ice
particles, then cover and return to the
freezer. After about 30 minutes, whisk
again until smooth, then fold in the egg
white. Continue freezing until firm.
6 Half an hour before serving, transfer
the sorbet to the refrigerator to allow it
to soften slightly.

MACARONI CHEESE
A creamy, comforting supper with
a mustard kick. Serve with a crisp
salad or steamed vegetables.
SERVES 6–8
1lb (500g) elbow macaroni or other dried pasta
4 tbsp butter, plus extra for greasing
¼ cup all-purpose flour
2 cups whole milk
1 tsp English mustard powder, such as Colman’s

1½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese
½ cup shredded Gruyère cheese
½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
¾ cup fresh white bread crumbs

MANAQISH
A classic Middle Eastern bread
served warm with yogurt and olives.
For the dough
3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus
extra if needed
1⅛ tsp quick-rising active dry yeast
(about half of a ¼oz (7g) envelope)
2 tsp salt
¼ cup extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for
greasing the bowl and brushing the edges
of the dough
For the topping
6 tbsp za’atar (see page 213)
½ cup extra virgin olive oil
1 Mix the flour, yeast, and salt in
a large mixing bowl. Make a well
in the center. Add the oil to the well
and, using the tips of your fingers,
rub the ¼ cup oil into the flour until
well incorporated. Gradually add 1
cup of lukewarm water, bringing in
the flour as you go. Knead until you
have a rough, sticky ball of dough.
2 Preheat the oven to the highest
temperature. Put the dough on a
floured work surface. Knead for 2–3
minutes, sprinkling with flour if the
dough sticks. Place a bowl over the
dough and let it rest for 15 minutes.
Continue kneading until the dough
is smooth and elastic. Shape the
dough into a ball, coating it with oil,
and place in an oiled bowl. Cover
with plastic wrap and let it rise in
a warm, draft-free place for 2 hours.
Fold after the first hour.
3 Divide the dough into 10 equal
parts. Roll each piece into a ball and
cover with a damp towel to let rise
for 45 minutes. Roll out each ball
of dough into a circle about 6–7 in
(15–17.5 cm) in diameter, flouring
both the work surface and the dough
every now and then, and making sure
to form even circles. Cover the dough
with floured parchment paper and let
rest for 15–20 minutes.
4 To make the topping, mix the
za’atar and ½ cup olive oil in a bowl.
Raise the edges of the disks of dough
by pinching them, and use your
fingertips to make dimples all over
the surface of the dough. Spread ⅛th
of the mixture over each circle of
dough. Brush the edges with oil and
let rest for 15–20 minutes.
5 Bake in the preheated oven for
6–8 minutes, or until nicely puffed
and barely golden. Serve immediately.

MANGO CHUTNEY
British empire-builders picked up
a taste for this Indian chutney and
brought the recipe back home with
them. It is usually served with curry,
but it also goes well with cheese.
Traditional, chutney is made with
unripe green mangoes, but these
can be hard to find, so this recipe
uses firm, semi-ripe mangoes
instead, which results in a fairly
sweet chutney with a light color.
MAKES ABOUT 51⁄2LB (2.5 KG)
CHUTNEY
2 cups granulated sugar
2 cups cider vinegar
4½lb (2kg) semi-ripe mangoes, peeled,
seeded, and cut into cubes
4oz fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated
4oz red chile peppers, seeded and cut
into very thin strips
½ cup dark raisins
2 tsp salt
1 Put the sugar and vinegar in a
flameproof casserole dish or large
saucepan. Cook over low heat,
stirring, until the sugar dissolves.
2 Add the mango, ginger, chiles,
raisins, and salt.
3 Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring
frequently.
4 Reduce the heat to low and simmer
for 1 hour, stirring occasionally, until
the mixture is thick.
5 Cool and pour into sterilized
jars. Seal according to the canning
manufacturer’s directions. The chutney
will keep for up to 1 year when stored
in a cool, drak place.

1 cup sherry vinegar
¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
finely grated zest of 1–2 lemons, to taste
sprigs of marjoram or thyme
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 Gut and bone the anchovies. Rinse
with cold water and pat dry. Lay
the fish in a single layer in a shallow
dish, sprinkle with salt, and pour
the vinegar over them. Cover and
refrigerate for 12–18 hours.
2 Drain away the salt and vinegar and
pat the fish dry. Arrange on a clean
serving dish and drizzle with the olive
oil, sprinkle with grated lemon zest
(add a squeeze of lemon juice, if you
like), and garnish with the marjoram.
Season with salt and pepper to serve.

MARMALADE
Bitter oranges such as Seville are
essential for a good marmalade.
MAKES ABOUT 20 CUPS
3lb (1.5kg) Seville oranges, rinsed well
juice of 2 lemons
61⁄2lb (3kg) granulated sugar, warmed
in a very low oven
1 Use a vegetable peeler or a thin
knife to peel the oranges without
removing any of the white pith
beneath. Cut the peel into thin or
medium strips, as preferred; set aside.
2 Halve the oranges and squeeze the
juice. Set aside. Also reserve the seeds.
3 Chop the remaining membranes and
white pith coarsely and tie in a muslin
bag with the seeds. Put this into a
heavy-bottomed pot or preserving pan
with the shredded peel.
4 Strain the orange and lemon juices
into the pan. Add 3 quarts (3.5 liters)
water. Slowly bring to a boil over
low heat, then simmer uncovered for
about 2 hours, or until the peel
is soft and the liquid has reduced
by about half.
5 Remove the muslin bag with a
slotted spoon and discard. Add the
warmed sugar to the pan and stir
until it has dissolved. Increase the
heat and boil the marmalade rapidly
for 15–20 minutes, or until setting
point is reached.
6 Skim off any foam from the surface
and leave to stand, off the heat, for
10–20 minutes. Stir the marmalade
once, then ladle into warmed
sterilized jars, cover, and seal.

OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER
A traditional lunch dish from
New Orleans that makes an
excellent first course.
SERVES 4
4 cups loosely packed baby spinach
leaves, rinsed but not dried
24 live oysters, in their shells, well scrubbed
⅓ cup loosely packed flat-leaf parsley leaves
4 large shallots, chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
8 tbsp (1 stick) butter, cut into pieces
⅓ cup all-purpose flour
2 flat anchovy fillets, drained and finely
chopped
pinch of cayenne pepper
salt and freshly ground black pepper
rock salt or other coarse salt
3 tbsp Pernod (anise liqueur)
1 Put the spinach in a saucepan over
medium heat with the water (from
rinsing) still clinging to its leaves.
Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5
minutes, or until wilted. Drain well,
squeeze to remove any excess liquid,
and set aside.
2 Meanwhile, discard any open oysters.
Shell one oyster, reserving the liquid
from the shell; then return it to its shell
and refrigerate. Repeat until all the
oysters have been opened. Refrigerate
the oyster juices until needed.
3 Chop the spinach, parsley, shallots,
garlic, and very finely with a knife,
or in a food processor; then set aside.
4 Melt the butter in a small saucepan
over medium heat. Add the flour, and
cook for 2 minutes, stirring, without
letting it brown. Gradually whisk in
the reserved oyster liquid to make a
smooth sauce. Then stir in the spinach
mixture, anchovies, cayenne, and
salt and pepper to taste (keeping
in mind that the anchovies are
salty). Cover the pan and leave
to simmer for 15 minutes.
5 Meanwhile, preheat the oven to
400°F (200°C). Arrange a thick layer
of rock salt in the serving dishes; then
put in the oven to warm briefly.
6 Uncover the spinach sauce and stir in
the Pernod. Taste the sauce, and adjust
the seasoning, if necessary. Remove the
dishes from the oven, and arrange 6 of
the chilled oysters in their shells on
each dish. (The salt keeps the oysters
level during cooking.) Spoon the sauce
over each oyster and bake for 5–10
minutes, or until the sauce is bubblyhot.

Turn off the heat, and stir in the
vanilla, then whisk in the gelatin until
completely incorporated. Strain the
vanilla-flavored cream into a liquid
measuring cup; then fill the prepared
molds and leave to cool completely.
Cover with plastic and refrigerate for
at least 3 hours until set.
3 Meanwhile, place the berries in a
blender or food processor and blend
to make a purée. Stir in 1–2 tbsp
sugar, then cover and set aside.
4 To serve, quickly dip the bottom of
each mold in hot water. Working with
one mold at a time, place a serving
plate on top and invert, giving a
gentle shake. Lift and remove the
mold, and set aside. Spoon the purée
around each panna cotta and garnish
with whole strawberries.

PEACH MELBA
According to legend, the opera singer
Dame Nellie Melba lent her name to
this truly great dessert that was
created in her honor by Escoffier.
SERVES 4
1½ cups fresh raspberries
1–2 tbsp superfine or granulated sugar
1 tsp fresh lemon juice
2 large, ripe peaches (or 4 small ones)
1 pint (500ml) vanilla ice cream
toasted, slivered almonds, to serve
1 Press the raspberries through
a nylon sieve to remove the seeds, then
place in a small nonreactive saucepan.
2 Set the pan over very low heat
to gently warm the purée, then stir in
the sugar with a wooden spoon. When
dissolved, remove from the heat and
stir in the lemon juice.
3 Allow to cool, then scrape into a
container, cover tightly, and refrigerate
for at least 1–2 hours, or overnight.
4 Shortly before serving, peel and halve
the peaches, and remove the pits.
5 Divide the ice cream among 4 chilled
serving dishes and top each with a
peach half. Spoon over some
of the Melba (raspberry) sauce over the
top and sprinkle with almonds.

PEARS IN RED WINE
Pears poached in red wine is
a simple but classic French dessert.
Serve with whipped cream, perhaps
flavored with pear brandy.
SERVES 4
4 large, firm pears, such as Bosc or
Conference
juice of 1 lemon
1 bottle (750ml) dry red wine, such as
Cabernet Sauvignon
⅔ cup granulated sugar
1 small stick cinnamon
1 Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).
Peel the pears and, working from the
bottom, remove the cores, keeping the
pears whole with the stems attached.
Sprinkle with the lemon juice to
prevent browning and set aside.
2 Put the wine, sugar, and cinnamon in
a small flameproof casserole dish. Bring
to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the
sugar. Add the pears in a single layer if
possible, cover, and transfer to the
oven. Cook for 2 hours, gently turning
the pears halfway through the cooking
time so they are evenly tinted red from
the wine.
3 Remove from the oven and leave
the pears to cool in the poaching liquid,
then use a slotted spoon to transfer
them to a serving dish.
4 Set the casserole dish over high heat
and boil the cooking liquid until it
is syrupy. Remove the cinnamon stick
and spoon the syrup over the pears.
Allow to cool, then refrigerate until
well chilled before serving.

PECAN PIE
This sweet, rich pie from the
American South could also be made
with brazil nuts or walnuts.
SERVES 6
9oz (250g) pie dough
9 tbsp butter
2 tbsp golden syrup, such as Lyle’s
(available in the imported-foods section
of many well-stocked supermarkets)
⅓ cup packed light brown sugar
⅓ cup packed dark brown sugar
2 cups pecan halves
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
Roll out the pastry and use it to line
an 8in (20cm) tart pan with a
removable bottom. Refrigerate for
about 10 minutes.
2 Prick the bottom of the pastry shell
all over with a fork, then line with
parchment paper and fill with pie
weights or dry beans. Bake for 15
minutes, or until a very light golden
brown. Lift out the beans and paper
and then bake for another 5 minutes
to crisp up the bottom of the shell.
Set aside.
3 Turn the oven down to 325°F
(160°C). Melt the butter with the
syrup in a medium saucepan, then
remove from the heat and stir in the
brown sugars and nuts. Allow to cool.
Stir in the beaten eggs.
4 Scrape the mixture into the tart
shell, spreading it evenly. Bake for
30–40 minutes, or until the crust is
golden and crisp; the filling should
still be slightly soft. Leave to cool
before serving.

PEPERONATA
Enjoy this Italian pepper stew hot or
cold, with crusty bread and a green
salad, with hot pasta or served
alongside grilled meat.
SERVES 4
2 tbsp olive oil

and cook for about 5 minutes, or until
soft and translucent. Stir in the garlic
and cook for a few more seconds.
2 Add the peppers and stir them
into the onion mixture. Cook over
very low heat for 5 minutes; then
cover and cook gently for 5–10
minutes, stirring occasionally to
prevent burning.
3 Add the tomatoes and season well
with salt and pepper. Partially cover
the pan and cook for about 20
minutes, or until the peppers are very
soft. Stir in the fresh basil leaves just
before serving.

PEPPERCORN SAUCE
This rich, creamy sauce is delicious
as an accompaniment to pan-fried
filet mignon or sirloin steak. Use
whole black or green peppercorns,
or a combination of the two.
SERVES 2
2 tbsp butter
1–1½ tsp black or green peppercorns to
taste, coarsely crushed in a pestle and
mortar, leaving some peppercorns whole
1 tbsp brandy
½ cup heavy whipping cream
salt
1 Add the butter to the frying pan in
which you have just cooked the steak;
if not cooking steak, use a small frying
pan. When the butter has melted and
is just beginning to bubble, add the
peppercorns and cook for 1 minute,
then add the brandy and cook for 1–2
minutes until the alcohol evaporates.
2 Stir in the cream and simmer for
2–4 minutes over low heat to blend
flavors and thicken slightly. Taste and
season with salt, if needed. Spoon the
sauce over the steak to serve.

PESTO
This Genoese sauce for pasta also
goes well with vegetables and as
a dip or spread for bruschetta.
SERVES 4–6
4 handfuls of fresh basil leaves
¼ cup pine nuts
¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan or
Pecorino cheese
1 large garlic clove, crushed
5–6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 Combine the basil, pine nuts,
cheese, and garlic in a food processor or
blender and blend, pulsing the machine
on and off, until finely chopped.
2 Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
With the machine running, add the
oil through the feed tube in a slow,
steady stream until a thick sauce is
formed. For a thinner sauce, add
more olive oil.
3 If you don’t have a processor, put
the basil and garlic in a mortar and
pound with a pestle. Add the pine
nuts, a few at a time, then the cheese
and oil alternately until you have a
thick paste. Add more oil if desired.

PETITS POIS À LA FRANÇAISE
This traditional French dish can be
made with canned petits pois when
fresh baby peas are not available.
SERVES 4–6
8oz (250g) pearl onions
5 tbsp butter, at room temperature
3 cups shelled baby peas, or frozen or
canned petits pois
½ cup ham stock or water
1 tsp granulated sugar
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp all-purpose flour
2 tbsp chopped fresh mint or parsley
2 hearts of lettuce, such as Little Gem,
trimmed and finely shredded

onion, drop into a pan of boiling water,
and cook until the water returns to a
boil; then rinse and drain the onions.
Peel the onions. Melt 2 tbsp of the
butter in a saucepan. Add the onions
and cook over medium heat for
2 minutes.
2 Add the peas and stock and bring to
a boil. Skim off any foam, and add the
sugar and season with salt and pepper.
Reduce the heat to low and simmer
gently for 5–8 minutes. Mix the
remaining butter with the flour to
make a paste.
3 In small pieces add the paste to the
pan, stirring constantly, thickening the
liquid. Stir in the mint or parsely and
lettuce and serve hot.

PICKLED WALNUTS
In Britain, unripened (or “green”),
immature walnuts have been
preserved in spiced vinegar since
the 17th century.
MAKES ABOUT 3LB (1.5KG)
1lb (450g) salt
2¼ lbs (1kg) shelled “green” walnuts
For the spiced vinegar
3½ cups malt vinegar
1 tbsp coriander seeds, crushed
12 allspice berries
2–3 red chiles, seeded if desired
½ cup muscovado, raw, or dark
brown sugar
1 To make the brine, in a large bowl
dissolve half of the salt in 2 cups hot
water. Allow to cool (a brine should
always be used cold to prevent
bacterial growth).
2 Prick the walnuts all over with a
silver or stainless-steel fork, then add
to the brine. Make sure that they are
submerged: weigh down with a plate
if necessary. Leave for 5 days.
3 Make a fresh batch of brine as above
with the remaining salt and another 2
cups hot water. Drain the walnuts,
submerge in the new brine, and leave
for another 7 days.
4 Drain the walnuts again and
spread, in a single layer, on a
baking sheet to dry for 2–3
days. Turn the nuts often and
leave them to dry until they
are uniformly black.
5 The day before you are due to
pickle the walnuts, make the spiced
vinegar. Combine the vinegar and
spices in a nonreactive saucepan and
bring to a boil. Add the sugar and stir
to dissolve, then remove from the
heat. Leave to infuse for 24 hours.
6 Strain the spiced vinegar into a
clean nonreactive saucepan and bring
to a boil to reheat. Pack the walnuts
into hot, sterilized jars, pushing them
down well, then cover with the hot,
spiced vinegar. Cover the jars with
vinegar-proof seals and label. Leave
the jarred nuts for at least 3 months
to mature before using.

PIKE QUENELLES
Pike fillets purée well for these
delicate French dumplings.
SERVES 4
2 tbsp butter, cut into pieces, plus 4 tbsp
butter, softened
2 tbsp all-purpose flour
5 tbsp whole milk
1 bay leaf
8oz (225g) pike fillet, cut into pieces
salt, freshly ground white pepper, and a
dash of freshly grated nutmeg
1 egg white
2 tbsp heavy whipping cream
1 For the white sauce, melt the 2 tbsp
butter in a small saucepan, stir in the
flour, and cook over medium-low heat
for 1–2 minutes, then whisk in the
milk; add the bay leaf. Stir until it
comes to a boil, and then reduce the
heat to low and simmer 2 minutes.
Scrape into a bowl to cool. Discard
bay leaf.
2 Process fish, salt, pepper, and
nutmeg until smooth. Cream in white
sauce, the 4 tbsp butter, and egg white
until blended.
3 Push the mixture through a fine
sieve into a bowl and refrigerate,
covered, for 45 minutes. Shape into
small ovals using 2 tablespoons.
Working in batches, gently lower the
quenelles into simmering water. Cook
over low heat for 8–10 minutes,
turning once, until the quenelles bob
to the surface and feel firm. Remove,
pat dry with paper towels, and serve
with beurre blanc (see page 67).

PLUM JAM
Most plum varieties make delicious
jam. Properly sealed jars can be stored
in a cool, dark place for up to a year,
but must be refrigerated after opening.
MAKES ABOUT 11 CUPS
3lbs (1.5kg) firm but ripe plums
3lbs (1.5kg) granulated or superfine sugar
1 Halve the plums and remove the
stones. (If the fruit is too hard to
remove them easily, you can cook with
the stones intact and let them loosen
naturally. Use a slotted spoon to scoop
them out when the jam is boiling.)
2 Put the fruit in a large heavybottomed
pot or preserving pan. The
pan should be no more than half full
to ensure sufficient space for rapid
boiling. Add 2 cups water and bring
to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer
gently for about 30 minutes, or until
soft. The exact time will depend on
the ripeness of the fruit.
3 Add the sugar and stir until it has
dissolved completely, then bring back
to a boil. Boil constantly and rapidly
for 15–20 minutes, or until the setting
point is reached.
4 Remove from the heat and skim any
foam from the surface of the jam. Let
the jam stand for about 5 minutes,
then ladle it into warmed sterilized
jars, cover, and seal.

POTATO GNOCCHI
These light-as-air potato dumplings,
served with a simple sage and butter
sauce, make a good supper dish.
SERVES 4
1lb 10oz (750g) russet or other floury
baking potatoes
2 large eggs, beaten
1⅓ cups all-purpose flour, as needed
For the sauce
10 tbsp butter
about 20 sage leaves
juice of 1⁄2 lemon
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 Cook the whole, unpeeled potatoes
in a pot of boiling water for about 25
minutes, or until just tender. Drain
and let cool. Peel the potatoes and
mash finely with a potato ricer or rub
through a wire sieve.
2 Place the warm mashed potatoes
on a work surface. Make a well in
the center. Add the eggs and 1⁄3 cup
of the flour into the well. Mix the
ingredients, using your hands, adding
more flour as needed, to make a soft
but not sticky dough that can be
shaped. Do not add too much flour
or the gnocchi will be heavy.
3 Divide the dough into 4 equal
portions. Roll each portion of dough
on a lightly floured work surface into
a rope about ¾in (2cm) thick. Cut
into pieces 1¼in (3cm) long. Press
each piece lightly with the back of
a fork to give the traditional concave
shape. Transfer the gnocchi to a
floured baking sheet.
4 Bring a large saucepan of lightly
salted water to a gentle boil. Add the
gnocchi and cook for 2 minutes, or
until they float to the surface.
5 Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat
the butter and sage in a frying pan
over medium heat until the butter has
melted. Add the lemon juice, and salt
and pepper to taste.

bottom. Prick the base with a fork, line
with parchment paper, and fill with pie
weights or dry beans.
4 Set the pan on the hot baking sheet
and bake blind for 20–25 minutes, or
until the pastry is crisp and lightly
browned. Remove from the oven,
keeping the pan on the baking sheet,
and carefully lift out the parchment
paper and weights. Set aside.
5 Combine the cream and sugar in a
saucepan. Scrape in the seeds from the
vanilla bean; add the pod. Bring to a boil,
then simmer gently, stirring occasionally,
until reduced by one-third. Leave to cool,
then discard the vanilla pod and whisk in
the egg yolks. Pour the mixture through
a fine sieve to remove any cooked egg.
6 Arrange the drained prunes on the
bottom of the pastry shell. Pour in the
custard; it is fine if some of the prunes
peep through. Bake for 35–40 minutes,
or until the custard is golden brown and
puffy, but still looks a little wobbly in
the center. Remove from the oven and
cool on a wire rack. Cut into wedges.

cheese pan). Put the raclette grill in the
center of the table and turn it on. Put
the covered pan or dish of potatoes on
top of the grill to keep warm.
4 To serve, set a slice of cheese on a
coupelle and place it under the grill.
Meanwhile, put one or two potatoes and
some of the accompaniments on your
dinner plate. When the cheese has
melted, slide it over the potatoes and eat
with the meats and accompaniments.
5 If you don’t have a raclette grill, put
all the potatoes in a shallow flameproof
dish, lay the cheese slices over them,
and place under a low broiler until the
cheese has melted. Serve with the
accompaniments.

RYE CRISPBREADS
These earthy crispbreads have a long
life, so they are ideal for having on
hand to serve with cheese, smoked
fish, or butter and jam.
MAKES 2
1¼ cups rye flour, plus extra for dusting
½ cup oat flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp from a cake of compressed yeast
1 In a mixing bowl, combine the rye
flour, oat flour, and salt. Crumble the
yeast into a liquid measuring cup and
add ¾ cup lukewarm water. Whisk
until the yeast dissolves. Stir the yeast
mixture into the dry ingredients to
make a smooth but sticky paste.
Cover with plastic wrap or a kitchen
towel and set aside to rise in a warm
place for 3 hours.
2 Line 3 large baking sheets with
parchment paper. Once the dough is
nicely puffed, divide it between 2 of
the sheet pans, spreading it out evenly.
Dust the surface generously with the
extra rye flour, then roll out the dough
on the pans to a thickness of ¼in
(5mm). Cover as before and leave to
rise for another hour, until the dough
has doubled in bulk.
3 Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
Cut each sheet of dough into a 12in
(30cm) circle, and cut a 1¾in (4cm)
hole in the center of each. Peel away
the excess dough and re-roll the
trimmings to make additional
crispbreads of any shape you
like, arranging them on the third
baking sheet. Use the rounded
end of a wooden spoon handle to
make dimples all over the surface
of the crispbreads.
4 Bake for 40 minutes for the large
rounds (and less for the smaller
pieces), or until the crispbreads are
dry and crisp at the edges. Remove
from the oven and leave to cool before
storing in an airtight container for up
to 5 days. To serve, have guests break
off pieces from the large rounds.

SAFFRON RICE
This beautifully colored rice is subtly
scented with saffron. It is especially
good served with chicken dishes.
SERVES 4
1½ cups white basmati rice or Thai
jasmine rice, rinsed under cold water
1⁄2 tsp saffron threads
pinch of salt
1 Add the rice to a medium-size
saucepan. In a large liquid measuring
cup or other heatproof container,
combine 3 cups of boiling water with
the saffron, stirring to dissolve.
Pour the saffron water over the rice,
add a pinch of salt and stir, bring to
a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover
the pan and cook the rice over low
heat for 12–15 minutes or until the
liquid has been absorbed. Remove
from the heat and leave the lid on
the pan for 5–10 minutes to allow
the rice to continue to steam.
2 When ready to serve, fluff the
rice with a fork and serve
immediately. Add a squeeze of
lemon juice if you wish.

SALADE NIÇOISE
This well-known, classic French
salad is substantial enough to be
served as a main dish.
SERVES 4
6oz (150g) green beans, trimmed
4 x 6oz (150g) tuna steaks
½ cup extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for
brushing
salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 tbsp white wine vinegar
juice of ½ lemon
2 tsp Dijon mustard
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
8oz (250g) ripe plum tomatoes,
quartered lengthwise
2 romaine lettuce hearts, trimmed and
torn into bite-size pieces
1 small red onion, thinly sliced
8 flat anchovy fillets in olive oil, drained
12 Niçoise or other black olives
8–10 basil leaves
4 eggs, hard-boiled
CLASSIC RECIPE
1 Cook the beans in a saucepan of
gently boiling water for 3–4 minutes,
or until crisp-tender. Drain the beans
in a colander and immediately turn
them into a bowl of ice water to stop
the cooking.
2 Preheat a ridged grill pan over
medium–high heat. Brush the tuna
steaks with 1–2 tablespoons olive oil
and season to taste with salt and
pepper. Sear the steaks for 2 minutes
on each side—the centers should still
be slightly pink. Set the tuna aside.
Drain the green beans again.
3 Meanwhile, make the vinaigrette.
Whisk together the vinegar, lemon
juice, mustard, and garlic. Whisk
in the ½ cup olive oil, and season
to taste.
4 Place the green beans, tomatoes,
lettuce, onion, anchovies, olives, and
basil in a large bowl. Drizzle with the
vinaigrette and toss gently to mix.
5 Divide the salad among 4 plates.
Peel and quarter each egg and add
them to the plates. Cut each tuna
steak in half and arrange both halves
on top of each salad.

SALSIFY FRITTERS
Serve these tasty Mediterranean
fritters as an easy side dish with
meat or fish.

1lb (400g) salsify, peeled and cut into
small, equal-size pieces
4 tbsp butter
1 garlic clove, crushed
freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp all-purpose flour
1 tbsp olive oil
1 Add the salsify to a pan of boiling
salted water and cook for about 20
minutes, or until beginning to soften.
Do not overcook. Drain well.
2 Mash the salsify, then add half the
butter, the garlic, and some pepper
and mash again. Divide into four
equal portions and then shape each
portion into a patty.
3 Dust both sides of the patties with
flour to coat lightly. Heat the olive oil
with the remaining butter in a
non-stick pan, add the patties, and
cook for about 2 minutes, or until the
bottoms are golden. Turn the patties
and cook the other sides for about 2
minutes. Serve hot.

SEA BASS IN A SALT CRUST (BRANZINO)
This classic northern Italian dish
is usually made using sea bass
(branzino) and served with aïoli
or mayonnaise.
SERVES 4
1 whole sea bass 3–4½lb (1.35–2kg)
trimmed and gutted, but not scaled
2lb (1kg) coarse sea salt
1–2 egg whites
1 Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
Gut the fish, making the smallest
incision possible. Clean well and
rinse; do not scale.
2 Place a large piece of foil on a
baking sheet, and spread a layer of salt
over the top. Arrange the fish on the
salt. Moisten the remaining salt with
the egg whites and a splash of water,
if necessary. Pack this mixture onto
the fish to encase completely it.
3 Bake for 22–25 minutes. Lift the fish
on to a serving dish. Take to the table
and carefully chip off any remaining salt
crust. Using clean utensils peel away the
skin and serve the fish off the bone.

SEA BREAM EN PAPILLOTE
A classic method of cooking fish—
wrapped in paper with a selection
of aromatics.
SERVES 1
1 small sea bream or porgy, trimmed,
scaled, and cut into fillets
a few slices of scallion or fennel
herbs of your choice (such as dill, tarragon,
rosemary, or oregano)
1 tbsp butter or a splash of olive oil
a splash of Pernod or white wine
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 lemon or lime wedges, to garnish
1 Preheat the oven to 425ºF (210ºC).
Arrange the fish fillets, skin-side down,
on a large sheet of parchment paper.
2 Arrange the chosen aromatic
vegetables and herbs around the fish and
season lightly with salt and pepper. Add
the butter; drizzle with Pernod or wine.
3 Enclose the fish securely by folding
the parchment over the fish to form a
“package.” Fold and crimp the edges,
but not too tightly, so that the steam can
circulate within the package as it bakes.
Bake 12–15 minutes or until cooked
through. The paper will have browned
and the fish will be firm and opaque.
4 Keeping the package intact, use a
spatula to transfer it to a warm dinner
plate. Slice open the package at the table.
Squeeze the lemon juice over the fish.

SESAME SHRIMP TOASTS
A combination of flavors that work
surprisingly well together.
SERVES 4
8oz (250g) raw tiger shrimp (prawns),
peeled, deveined, and coarsely chopped
2 scallions, coarsely chopped
1/2in (1cm) piece of fresh ginger, peeled
and finely grated
1 tsp soy sauce
1⁄2 tsp sugar
1⁄2 tsp Asian sesame oil
1 small egg white, lightly beaten
freshly ground black pepper
3 slices white bread, crusts removed
2 tbsp sesame seeds
peanut or vegetable oil, for frying
cilantro leaves, for garnish
1 Combine the shrimp and scallions
in a food processor and process for a
few seconds to make a paste.
Transfer the paste to a bowl and
stir in the ginger, soy sauce,
sugar, sesame oil, and enough
egg white to bind the mixture
together. Season with pepper.
2 Cut each slice of bread into 4
triangles and spread each
thickly with the prawn paste.
Sprinkle the sesame seeds
evenly over the top.
3 Heat the oil to 350°F
(180°C) in a deep-fat fryer or
other deep pot. Working in batches,
fry the toasts, shrimp-side down, for
2 minutes. Carefully turn them over
and fry for another 2 minutes, or
until golden-brown and crisp.
4 Lift the toasts out of the pot with a
slotted spoon and drain on paper
towels. Serve warm, garnished
with cilantro.

SHALLOW-FRIED RED MULLET
Pan-frying, a simple method of
cooking, makes the most of the
delicate sweetness of red mullet.
SERVES 4
4 red mullet, gutted, scaled, trimmed, and
heads removed
salt and freshly ground black pepper
yellow cornmeal or polenta, for coating
grapeseed or canola oil, for frying
lemon juice, to finish
1 Season the fish, then coat
them on both sides with
cornmeal or polenta,
shaking off any excess.
Set a non-stick or cast-iron
frying pan over medium-high
heat; add enough oil to coat the
bottom of the pan.
2 Put the prepared fish into the hot
oil, presentation-side (the side that
will show when served) face-down.
Cook for 2 minutes, or until the fish is
golden brown.
3 Turn the fish using tongs, and cook
until the other side is golden brown.
To test for doneness, insert a
thin-bladed knife into the center of
the fish, and then touch the tip of the
knife to your thumb. If the knife is
warm, the fish is ready. Drain briefly
on paper towels.

good with spaghetti and other pasta.
SERVES 4
1lb (450g) dried pasta
6 tbsp butter
2 garlic cloves, peeled and halved
16 fresh sage leaves
freshly grated Parmesan, for serving
1 Cook the pasta in a large pot of
boiling, salted water, until tender yet
firm to the bite, about 10 minutes or as
the package directs. While the pasta is
cooking, heat the butter and garlic in a
small frying pan over medium heat until
just golden. Add the sage leaves and
cook, stirring, until fragrant, for about
30 seconds. Add salt and pepper to
taste. Remove from the heat; discard
the garlic.

SKATE WITH BEURRE NOIR AND CAPERS
Skate can be cooked in a number of
ways; for this French classic, poach
in a lightly acidulated court bouillon.
SERVES 2
1 cup dry white wine
1 onion, sliced
1 carrot, sliced
1 celery rib, sliced
2 glasses white wine
1 bay leaf
2 x 6oz (170g) skate wings, skinned
4 tbsp butter
2 tbsp white or red wine vinegar
2 tsp capers
2 tsp chopped parsley
1 To make the court bouillon,
combine 12 cups (3 quarts/3 liters)
water, the wine, onion, carrot, celery,
and bay leaf in a large sauté pan or
flameproof casserole, bring to a boil
and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove
from the heat and let cool for a
few minutes.
2 Lower the skate into the court
bouillon, bring to a boil, reduce
the heat to low, and cook for 10–12
minutes. The fish is cooked when the
thick part of the cartilage at the
“shoulder” of the wing will pull away
easily. Lift onto a plate and pat dry
with paper towels.
3 Melt the butter in a large frying pan,
allow it to sizzle and then keep
cooking until it has turned very dark
brown, but is not smoking. Stir in the
vinegar, capers, and parsley and while
it is sizzling furiously, immediately
pour it over the skate wings to serve.

SMOKED MACKEREL PÂTÉ
Scottish mackerel are especially
suitable for smoking. This paté is
traditionally served with Melba toast
or vegetable crudités.

horseradish, then pulse until the
mixture is well blended and smooth.
2 Stir in the lemon juice to taste, and
season with salt and freshly ground
black pepper.

SNAILS IN GARLIC BUTTER
Escargot de Bourgogne (Burgundy
snails), made with big, meaty garden
snails, are a classic French delicacy.
SERVES 2
4 tbsp butter, softened
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 tbsp chopped parsley
squeeze of fresh lemon juice
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 x 14oz (410g) can escargots with shells
1 Make the garlic butter: combine the
butter, garlic, and parsley in a food
processor, and process to form
a green butter. Add lemon juice and
seasoning to taste.
2 Drain the snails of any juice. Pack
some garlic butter into each shell; place
a snail on top. Press more butter on top
of the snails so that they are tightly
packed inside the shells. The snails
should not be visible, but fully covered
in butter. Chill until ready to bake.
3 Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC).
Arrange the snail shells in a snail plate
that supports the shell, or lay them out
in a small baking dish, ensuring that
the shells cannot tip over.

until the butter has melted and the
snails are piping hot. Serve with
plenty of baguette.

SOLE MEUNIÈRE
Cooking small whole fish or fillets
in clarified butter (la meunière) is a
typically French way of preparing
fish simply.
SERVES 2
2 lemon sole, filleted and skinned, or
4 sole fillets
2 tbsp all-purpose flour
salt and freshly ground black pepper
4–6 tbsp clarified butter
2 tbsp finely chopped parsley
juice of half a lemon
1 Dust the sole fillets in the flour, salt,
and pepper until well coated. Arrange
them in a single layer on a plate (do
not stack as they will stick together
and the flour will become soggy).
2 Heat half of the butter in a large
frying pan until it is no longer
sizzling. Working in batches if
necessary, lower in the fillets and press
down gently with a spatula. Cook for
1 minute. Turn the fish over and cook
on the second side for another 30
seconds or so; the fish is cooked when
it is firm and opaque. Transfer to a
warm plate and keep warm.
3 Wipe out the frying pan with a
paper towel and add the remaining
2–3 tbsp clarified butter. Allow it to
cook for a few seconds until it turns
golden brown, then stir in the
chopped parsley and a squeeze of
lemon juice, and pour, still sizzling,
over the fish to serve.

the cooking water. Return the spaghetti
to the empty pot, along with the
reserved cooking water. Add the garlic
and the truffles with the remaining oil,
and toss gently to mix. Serve
immediately, sprinkled with cheese,
if you wish.

SPANAKOPITA
A Greek dish of spinach and dill
layered with filo pastry. Crumble some
feta cheese over the spinach filling, if
you like.
SERVES 6
21⁄2lb (1.1kg) spinach leaves,
washed well to remove any dirt
or grit, then chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 bunch of scallions, trimmed and
finely chopped
½ cup finely chopped fresh dill weed
pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
1 egg, lightly beaten
10 sheets fresh or thawed frozen filo dough
3–4 tbsp olive oil
melted butter to glaze
1 Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
First, cook the spinach: put it into
a large, heavy saucepan, sprinkle in
a little water, and add a pinch of salt.
Cook gently for a few minutes until the
spinach starts to wilt. Drain, then
squeeze as much water as possible
from the spinach. Put it in a bowl,
add the scallions and dill, and stir to
combine. Season with the nutmeg, and
salt and pepper to taste. Mix in the egg.
2 Keep the filo covered with plastic
wrap to prevent it from drying out,
removing the sheets one at a time,
as needed. Oil a 9in (23cm)
square baking pan. Layer
5 sheets in the pan, brushing
each one with oil before you
lay it in the pan (fold the
excess pastry back into the
pan). Spoon the spinach
mixture on top and spread
out to cover the pastry. Top
with 5 more sheets of filo,
brushing each with oil as before.
Finally, brush the top generously
with melted butter.
3 With a sharp knife, mark the pie
into 6 squares. Bake for 30–35
minutes, or until the pastry is golden.
Allow to cool slightly before cutting
into squares to serve, or let cool and
serve at room temperature.

SPANISH OMELET
The traditional flat omelet, known as
tortilla in Spain, is made with just
potatoes, onions, and eggs.
SERVES 4
5 medium potatoes (any type)
1 cup olive oil
3 medium onions, quartered and sliced
into thin crescents
salt and freshly ground black pepper
5 eggs
1 Peel the potatoes and cut into slices
about ¼in (5mm) thick. Heat the olive
oil in a deep-sided ovenproof frying
pan (preferably non-stick). Add the
potatoes, and cook at a gentle simmer
for about 15 minutes, or until the
potatoes are soft when you test them
with a sharp knife. Remove the
potatoes with a slotted spoon and put
them in a large bowl to cool.
2 Pour most of the oil out of the pan
(you can strain it and re-use in
step 4). Add the onions and a pinch
of salt. Cook over low heat until
the onions are soft and beginning to
caramelize. Add to the potatoes and
leave to cool.
3 Whisk the eggs with a fork, then
pour into the cooled potato and onion
mixture. Season with salt and pepper.
Fold together gently so all the potato
slices are coated, trying not to break
them up too much.
4 Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
Heat 1 tbsp of the strained olive oil
in the frying pan until hot, then
carefully slide in the potato mixture,
spreading it evenly in the pan. Reduce
the heat to medium-low and cook for
6–10 minutes, or until almost set.
5 Transfer the pan to the oven and
bake for 10 minutes, or until set and
golden. Alternatively, after cooking the
first side of the omelet, invert it on to
a plate and slide it back into the pan
to cook the other side.
6 Remove from the pan and allow to
cool slightly (or completely), then
slice into wedges. Serve warm, at
room temperature, or cold.

brown. Remove from the oven and
leave to cool completely. Store in an
airtight tin.

SPICED KUMQUATS
You can serve this modern classic
either with creamy desserts or with
savory meats such as duck, pork,
or ham. The compote keeps well for
several weeks in the refrigerator.
SERVES 4–6
1lb (450g) kumquats
⅔ cup granulated sugar
1 small cinnamon stick
4 cloves
2 cardamom pods
1 star anise
1 Cut the kumquats in half and
discard the seeds.
2 Place in a heavy-bottomed saucepan
with the sugar, spices, and ½ cup
water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the
heat and simmer very gently,
uncovered, for 20–30 minutes, or
until tender.
3 Remove from the heat and leave to
cool, then refrigerate. If desired,
remove the spices before serving.

STAR ANISE COOKIES
These are melt-in-the-mouth
cookies, with the warm hit of licorice
from the star anise lingering after
each bite. Use fresh star anise, with
plenty of flavor and aroma.
MAKES 18–20 COOKIES
8 star anise seeds, removed from pods
and finely ground in a spice grinder or
with a mortar and pestle
1 cup self-rising flour
1 tsp baking powder
¼ cup light brown sugar
4 tbsp honey
7 tbsp butter, melted and cooled slightly
1 Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
Put the finely ground star anise into a
bowl (if there are still lumps, sieve to
remove them), and add the flour,
baking powder, and brown sugar; mix
together. Now stir in the honey,
followed by the melted butter; mix
well with a wooden spoon.
2 Lightly grease a baking sheet or line
with parchment paper. Scoop up a
heaping teaspoon of the mixture and
drop it onto the baking sheet, pressing
it down gently with your hand. Make
sure there is at least 2in (5cm)
between each cookie, as they will
spread a little during baking.
3 Bake for 10–15 minutes or until just
beginning to turn golden. The cookies
may still be a little soft, but they will
firm up as they cool. Leave on the
baking sheet to cool for 5 minutes,
then transfer to a wire rack to cool
completely. The cookies are delicious
either by themselves or served with a
glass of dessert wine.

STEAMED ARTICHOKES
This simple, traditional French way
of preparing artichokes is a true
classic and needs no embellishment.
SERVES 1
1 artichoke
4 tbsp butter
juice of 1⁄2 lemon
salt and freshly ground black pepper
bay leaves and fresh rosemary stalks,
to serve (optional)
1 Break off any tough outer leaves from
the artichoke and trim the stem level
with the base. Snip off the pointed
tips from the remaining leaves.
2 Set the artichoke in a vegetable
steamer (you can flavor the steaming
water with bay and rosemary sprigs,
if you wish). Cover and steam for
about 30 minutes, or until you can pull
away an outer leaf with complete ease.
3 Melt the butter in a small pan, then
add the lemon juice and season with
salt and pepper. Pour the warm lemon
butter into a ramekin and serve
alongside the hot artichoke.
4 To eat, pluck off the leaves, one by
one, dip the fleshy end in the melted
butter, and scrape off the flesh with your
teeth; discard the leaf. When you get to
the little cone of pale inner leaves, pull
this out to reveal the hairy choke; scoop
all of this out with a spoon and discard.
Then enjoy eating the succulent heart
with the rest of the melted butter.

reserving the fat. Cover the goose with
foil, lower the heat to 375°F (190°C),
and roast for 1½ hours. Drain off fat
again. Remove the foil and roast for
a final 30 minutes. Transfer the goose
om to a warm serving platter, cover
loosely, and allow to rest for 30
minutes before carving.
4 To make the gravy, heat 3 tbsp of
goose fat in a saucepan, stir in the
flour, and cook for 5 minutes over low
heat. Gradually whisk in enough hot
giblet stock until the mixture has the
consistency of gravy. When the goose
has been removed from the roasting
pan to rest, pour off all the fat from
the pan and add the gravy. Cook over
low heat, using a wooden spoon to
scrape up any browned bits from the
bottom of the pan. Strain the gravy
through a fine sieve and keep warm.
Strain the gravy.
5 Carve the goose and serve with the
gravy, stuffing, and tart apple sauce.

TARTE TATIN
At the Tatin sisters’ restaurant in
the Loire Valley, they created this
upside-down apple tart on a pastry
base. Use apples that keep their
shape, such as Golden Delicious.
CLASSIC RECIPE
SERVES 4–6
2lb (900g) apples
juice of 1⁄2 lemon
¾ cup sugar
11 tbsp (1 stick plus 3 tbsp) unsalted butter
1 sheet of cold, prepared sweet shortcrust
pastry, pie dough, or puff pastry (enough
for a 9–10in (23cm) pie
1 Preheat the oven to 400􀂃F (200􀂃C).
2 Peel, core, and quarter the apples.
Sprinkle with lemon juice and set aside.
3 Gently melt the sugar in a 12in (30cm)
cast-iron frying pan or other shallow
flameproof pan. When the sugar starts to
caramelize, add the butter and cook
until it looks like crunchy crumbs of
toffee. Take the pan off the heat.
4 Add the apples to the pan, packing the
apples closely together, overlapping, if
necessary.
5 Place over medium–low heat and cook
for 15–20 minutes. The butter–sugar
mix will become thick and syrupy as it
bubbles up around the apples. Do not
stir or move the apples. Set aside to cool.
6 If needed, roll out the pastry into a
circle large enough to cover the pan.
Lay the sheet of pastry over the cooled
apples. Trim neatly and push the edges
down the inside of the pan to enclose
the apples.
7 Bake for 20–30 minutes, until the
crust is crisp and golden brown and the
apple filling is bubbly-hot.
8 Cool in the pan for 5–10 minutes.
Place a heatproof serving plate over the
pan and carefully invert the tart onto the
platter, using oven gloves to protect your
hands and arms. Cut into wedges and
serve warm or at room temperature.

1 carrot, sliced
1 celery rib, sliced
½ cup dry white wine
1 bay leaf
2 trout, scaled, trimmed, gutted,

simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from
the heat to cool for a few minutes.
2 Lower the trout into the court
bouillon, bring to a boil, reduce the
heat and cook over low heat for
12–15 minutes. The fish will be
cooked when the eyes turn white and
the skin easily pulls away from the
flesh. Lift onto a plate and pat dry,
pull away the skin and remove any
fins. Arrange on a serving platter;
keep warm.
3 Melt the butter in a large frying pan,
add the almonds and cook over low

VANILLA ICE CREAM
Nothing beats creamy homemade
vanilla ice cream. This is delicious
served with fresh berries, macaroons,
biscotti, or other cookies crumbled
into the bottom of the serving glass.
SERVES 4
1 vanilla bean
1¼ cups whole milk
3 egg yolks
½ cup superfine sugar
1¼ cups heavy whipping cream
1 Split the vanilla bean lengthwise with
the tip of a sharp knife. Scrape out the
seeds. Put seeds, pod, and milk into a
heavy saucepan. Heat gently to a
simmer; do not boil. Remove from the
heat, cover, and set aside for 30 minutes
to infuse the milk. Remove the pod.
2 Beat the egg yolks and sugar in a large
bowl. Stir in the infused milk, then
return the mixture to the saucepan.
3 Cook over low heat, stirring constantly,
until the mixture thickens slightly and
just coats the back of a spoon. Do not
boil or the custard will curdle.
4 Pour the mixture through a sieve
into a bowl. Cover and refrigerate
until thoroughly chilled.
5 Whip the cream until very soft peaks
form, and fold into the cold custard.
6 To freeze using an ice cream maker,
churn according to manufacturer’s
instructions. (This usually takes
20–30 minutes.) Transfer to a
freezer-safe container and freeze
until needed. To freeze the ice
cream without a machine, pour the
mixture into a freezer-safe container
and freeze for at least 3–4 hours, then
whisk to break up any ice crystals.
Freeze for another 2 hours and repeat
the process; freeze until ready to use.
7 To serve the ice cream, remove it from
the freezer 10–20 minutes prior to
scooping. Machine-churned ice cream
will keep for up to 1 month in the
freezer; manually-frozen ice cream is
best served within 1 week, to prevent
ice crystals from forming.

then season with salt and pepper. Bring
to a boil, stirring all the time, then
cover with a lid and simmer for 30
minutes or until the vegetables are
tender. Stir in the ½ cup cream and
cook over low heat for 1 minute.
3 Remove the pan from the heat and
leave to cool slightly, then, working in
batches, process the soup in a blender
until very smooth. Season to taste
with salt and pepper, then chill for at
least 3 hours. To serve, pour into
bowls, stir a little cream into each,
then sprinkle with the chives and
more freshly ground black pepper.

MAKE WHITE BREAD 
Try this recipe at least twice: once you
get into the habit of baking bread
at home you’ll find it fits easily into
your lifestyle and the inferior
flavor of store-bought loaves
simply doesn’t compare.
Ingredients
½oz (15g) fresh yeast (dissolved in 1¼ cups
lukewarm water), or 1 x ¼oz (7g) envelope
quick-rising active dry yeast
4 cups bread flour, plus extra for dusting
2 tsp fine sea salt
oil, for greasing
1 Sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl.
Pour the yeast liquid (or dry yeast) into the
bowl and stir. Work the mixture into a dough
with your hands, kneading until it comes away
cleanly away from the sides of the bowl.
2 Turn the dough out onto a lightly dusted
work surface. Knead until the dough is smooth
and firm, not sticky. Return the dough to the
bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel and
leave in a warm place.
3 Once the dough has doubled in size—this
should take about 1–2 hours—remove from
the bowl and return to a lightly dusted work
surface. Punch the dough down and knead
well to punch the air out of the risen dough.
4 Cut the dough in half and use your hands
to shape each piece into a rounded rectangle.
Grease a loaf pan and ease both pieces of
dough into it side by side. Cover with a kitchen
towel and leave to rise for about 30 minutes.
5 Bake in the center of a 425°F (220°C) oven
for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375°F
(190°C) and bake for another 30 minutes.
To check doneness, rap the base with your
knuckle. The loaf should sound hollow.

BREAD
Ingredients
½oz (15g) fresh yeast (dissolved in
1¼ cups lukewarm water), or
1 x ¼oz (7g) envelope quick-rising
active dry yeast
2 cups bread flour, plus extra for dusting
2 cups whole wheat flour
2 tsp fine sea salt
oil, for greasing
To make, use the same
method given for white
bread, opposite.
The two types of flour
used in this recipe give
the bread a lighter, moister
texture than regular whole
wheat bread. If you prefer
a denser, heavier whole
wheat loaf, use 4 cups whole
wheat flour and omit the
bread flour.
